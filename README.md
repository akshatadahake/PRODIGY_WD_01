Responsive Landing Page
ðŸš€ Task 01 Completed â€“ Responsive Landing Page
I'm excited to share that I've successfully completed the first task of my web development internship at Prodigy InfoTech!

For this task, I built the foundational layout of a responsive landing page, focusing on clean design and user-friendly navigation. Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I was able to create:

âœ… A fully responsive navigation bar
âœ… A toggleable sidebar for mobile views
âœ… The basic structure for the Home page

This was a great hands-on experience that helped sharpen my front-end development skills. Looking forward to the upcoming challenges!
